# TinyURL

A simple client for my personal and self-deployed [tinyurl service](https://zbcai.xyz).



The backend system is a RESTful service built upon [Restify](http://restify.com/) while the frontend is written in [React](http://restify.com/) with ES6.



## TODO

- [ ] Perform Redux support
- [ ] Change `reqwest` into `fetch`
