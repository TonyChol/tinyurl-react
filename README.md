# TinyURL

A simple client for my personal and self-deployed [tinyurl service](https://zbcai.xyz). 



The backend system is a RESTful service built upon [Restify](http://restify.com/) while the frontend is written in [React](http://restify.com/) with ES6.

#### [Demo](https://zbcai.xyz/)

## Usage

The boilerplate is built based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode:

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to `./build` folder. 

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.



## TODO

- [ ] Perform Redux support
- [ ] Change `reqwest` into `fetch`
